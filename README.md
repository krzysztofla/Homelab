# Homelab

## Why building Homelab? 
I created this homelab just to have fun and place for my hacking ideas where I can build, experiment, test, adjust and break stuff. I want to constantly sharp my skills and such phisical enviorement is a greate place for that. Some people can say yeah... but why not just use vm's... It's all about feeling! Connecting to you phisical hardwere from your couch and knowing it is running at your cave is totaly different expirience. Besides that, issues that I'm facing when building on phisical hardware are slightly different then I'm expiriencing when working in often managed Cloud infrastructure.
